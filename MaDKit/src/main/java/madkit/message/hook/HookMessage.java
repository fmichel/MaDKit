	 * This message should be used to request or release a hook on an agent action. The
	 * message should be sent to the kernel (which is the manager of the SYSTEM group in the
	 * local community), here is an example :
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * <code>
	 * sendMessage(

	 * 	Organization.GROUP_MANAGER_ROLE,

	 * 
	 * In this example, the sender will be informed by the kernel of all successful
	 * requestRole operation made by the agents. This information will be transmitted using a
	 * subclass of HookMessage depending on the nature of the event. That is,
	 * {@link OrganizationEvent}, {@link MessageEvent} or {@link AgentLifeEvent} messages will
	 * be sent by the kernel according to the type of the hook which has been requested.
	 * <p>
	 * To give up the hook, just send to the kernel another message built with the same action
	 * and it will remove the sender from the subscriber list.
	 * 
	 * @param hookType the action event type to monitor
	 * @see AgentActionEvent
